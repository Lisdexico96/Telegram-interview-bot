                    SCRIPT LAUNCHER - BUTTON EXPLANATIONS
===============================================================================

This document explains what each button in the Script Launcher does and when
to use them.

===============================================================================
1. RECREATE DATABASE
===============================================================================

WHAT IT DOES:
    - Completely deletes the existing database file (interview.db)
    - Creates a brand new database with the correct schema
    - Rebuilds both the candidates and responses tables from scratch

WHEN TO USE:
    - When you need to start completely fresh
    - When the database file is corrupted beyond repair
    - When you want to ensure the database has the exact correct schema
    - When setting up the bot for the first time

WARNING:
    ⚠️ This will PERMANENTLY DELETE all existing data!
    ⚠️ You will lose all candidates, responses, and interview history
    ⚠️ This action cannot be undone

CONFIRMATION:
    - The launcher will ask for confirmation before running this script
    - Make sure you really want to delete everything before proceeding

RESULT:
    - A fresh, empty database with the correct structure
    - Ready to start accepting new interviews

===============================================================================
2. RESET DATABASE
===============================================================================

WHAT IT DOES:
    - Clears all data from the database (candidates and responses)
    - Keeps the database file and structure intact
    - Preserves the table schema and columns

WHEN TO USE:
    - During testing when you want to clear test data
    - When you want to start fresh without recreating the database structure
    - When resetting the bot between test sessions
    - After completing a batch of interviews and starting a new batch

WARNING:
    ⚠️ This will DELETE all interview data
    ⚠️ All candidates and their responses will be removed
    ⚠️ This action cannot be undone

CONFIRMATION:
    - The launcher will ask for confirmation before running this script
    - The script requires the --yes flag (handled automatically by the GUI)

RESULT:
    - An empty database with the same structure
    - All tables remain but contain no data
    - Ready for new interviews

===============================================================================
3. FIX DATABASE
===============================================================================

WHAT IT DOES:
    - Adds any missing columns to the candidates table
    - Updates the database schema to match the current requirements
    - Clears all existing data from the database

WHEN TO USE:
    - When the database schema is outdated (after code updates)
    - When you're getting errors about missing columns
    - When the database structure needs to be updated
    - After updating the bot code that requires new database fields

WARNING:
    ⚠️ This will CLEAR all data from the database
    ⚠️ All candidates and responses will be deleted
    ⚠️ This action cannot be undone

CONFIRMATION:
    - The launcher will ask for confirmation before running this script

RESULT:
    - Database schema updated with all required columns
    - An empty database with the correct, up-to-date structure
    - Ready for new interviews with the latest schema

SCHEMA CHANGES:
    The script checks for and adds these columns if missing:
    - name (TEXT)
    - completed (INTEGER)
    - decision (TEXT)
    - feedback (TEXT)
    - has_completed_interview (INTEGER)

===============================================================================
4. CHECK DATABASE
===============================================================================

WHAT IT DOES:
    - Displays information about the current database
    - Shows database file location and size
    - Lists all table columns and their types
    - Counts candidates and responses
    - Displays detailed information about all candidates

WHEN TO USE:
    - To verify database status and structure
    - To see how many candidates are in the database
    - To check the database schema
    - To troubleshoot database-related issues
    - Before making changes to understand current state

WARNING:
    ✅ This is a READ-ONLY operation
    ✅ No data will be modified or deleted
    ✅ Safe to run anytime

CONFIRMATION:
    - No confirmation needed - this is a safe operation

RESULT:
    - Detailed report displayed in the output window:
      * Database file location and size
      * Table structure (columns and types)
      * Number of candidates
      * Number of responses
      * Detailed candidate information

===============================================================================
5. STOP BOT
===============================================================================

WHAT IT DOES:
    - Finds all running bot processes (Python processes running bot.py)
    - Stops (kills) those processes
    - Used to shut down the Telegram bot cleanly

WHEN TO USE:
    - When the bot is running and you need to stop it
    - Before running database scripts (to avoid conflicts)
    - When the bot is frozen or not responding
    - When you need to restart the bot

WARNING:
    ⚠️ This will forcefully stop the bot
    ⚠️ Any in-progress interviews may be interrupted
    ⚠️ Make sure to save any important data first

CONFIRMATION:
    - No confirmation needed - this is typically a safe operation

RESULT:
    - All bot processes are stopped
    - The bot is no longer running
    - You can now safely run database operations
    - Ready to restart the bot if needed

PLATFORM SUPPORT:
    - Windows: Uses stop_bot.bat (batch file)
    - Linux/Mac: Uses stop_bot.sh (shell script)
    - The correct script is automatically selected based on your OS

===============================================================================
GENERAL INFORMATION
===============================================================================

OUTPUT WINDOW:
    - All script output appears in the output window below the buttons
    - You can scroll through the output to see all messages
    - Use the "Clear Output" button to clear the output window
    - Output shows in real-time as scripts execute

BUTTON STATES:
    - Buttons are disabled (grayed out) while a script is running
    - Buttons re-enable automatically when the script finishes
    - You can run only one script at a time

ERROR HANDLING:
    - If a script fails, an error message will be shown
    - Check the output window for detailed error information
    - Some scripts may show warnings or informational messages

BEST PRACTICES:
    1. Always stop the bot before running database scripts
    2. Check the database status before making changes
    3. Make backups if you have important data
    4. Read warnings carefully before confirming destructive operations
    5. Use "Check Database" to verify changes after operations

TYPICAL WORKFLOW:
    1. Stop Bot (if running)
    2. Check Database (to see current state)
    3. Run appropriate database script (Reset/Fix/Recreate)
    4. Check Database again (to verify changes)
    5. Restart Bot (if needed)
